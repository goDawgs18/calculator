# calculator
For this project I will create a calculator that will consist of an Arduino uno, 4x4 pin pad, LCD 1602, and an LED. The calculator will work like a basic four function calculator (multiply, divide, add, and subtract) but it also signal when the result is a prime number by turning on a LED
